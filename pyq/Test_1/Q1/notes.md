# Notes on MySQLi Object-Oriented Approach and File Superglobal

## MySQLi Object-Oriented Approach

The MySQLi (MySQL Improved) extension provides a way to interact with MySQL databases using an object-oriented approach. Here are some key points:

### Connecting to a Database
```php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "database";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully";
```

### Performing Queries
```php
$sql = "SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM MyGuests";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    // Output data of each row
    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        echo "id: " . $row["id"]. " - Name: " . $row["firstname"]. " " . $row["lastname"]. "<br>";
    }
} else {
    echo "0 results";
}
```

### Closing the Connection
```php
$conn->close();
```

## File Superglobal

The `$_FILES` superglobal is used to handle file uploads in PHP. It is an associative array containing items uploaded via HTTP POST method.

### Example of File Upload
```php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $target_dir = "uploads/";
    $target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]);
    $uploadOk = 1;
    $imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));

    // Check if file is an actual image or fake image
    $check = getimagesize($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"]);
    if ($check !== false) {
        echo "File is an image - " . $check["mime"] . ".";
        $uploadOk = 1;
    } else {
        echo "File is not an image.";
        $uploadOk = 0;
    }

    // Check if file already exists
    if (file_exists($target_file)) {
        echo "Sorry, file already exists.";
        $uploadOk = 0;
    }

    // Check file size
    if ($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["size"] > 500000) {
        echo "Sorry, your file is too large.";
        $uploadOk = 0;
    }

    // Allow certain file formats
    if ($imageFileType != "jpg" && $imageFileType != "png" && $imageFileType != "jpeg" && $imageFileType != "gif") {
        echo "Sorry, only JPG, JPEG, PNG & GIF files are allowed.";
        $uploadOk = 0;
    }

    // Check if $uploadOk is set to 0 by an error
    if ($uploadOk == 0) {
        echo "Sorry, your file was not uploaded.";
    // If everything is ok, try to upload file
    } else {
        if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
            echo "The file ". htmlspecialchars(basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"])). " has been uploaded.";
        } else {
            echo "Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.";
        }
    }
}
```

### Accessing File Information
- `$_FILES['fileToUpload']['name']` - The original name of the file.
- `$_FILES['fileToUpload']['type']` - The MIME type of the file.
- `$_FILES['fileToUpload']['size']` - The size of the file in bytes.
- `$_FILES['fileToUpload']['tmp_name']` - The temporary filename of the file in which the uploaded file was stored on the server.
- `$_FILES['fileToUpload']['error']` - The error code associated with the file upload.
